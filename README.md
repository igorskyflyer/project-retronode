  <em>🔙 Project RetroNode: Preserving the Legacy, Embracing the New 🔝</em>
</div>

<br>

🧬 Project RetroNode is a simple yet vital initiative aimed at maintaining backwards compatibility for my existing npm modules. As the developer behind these modules, I am committed to ensuring that users of my packages can seamlessly transition between CommonJS and ES modules without disruption.

RetroNode serves as a documentation of my efforts to preserve compatibility, allowing fellow developers to understand the considerations and strategies taken to ensure smooth integration. While the project itself may not actively perform technical tasks, it stands as a guiding principle and commitment to the community.

Join me on this modest but crucial journey as we uphold the value of legacy code while embracing the advancements of ES modules. Together, we create a reliable and cohesive ecosystem that fosters accessibility and ease of use for all developers relying on these npm modules. Let's make JavaScript development a seamless experience for everyone! 🚀
